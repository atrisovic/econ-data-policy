# Economics Data Policies

Data policies in top economics journals and their focus on result replication/reproducibility.

## Overview

The ranking list of journals was obtained from: https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.journals.all.html

## 1. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Oxford University Press

"In an effort to promote consistent standards and requirements among general-interest journals in the field of economics, the Quarterly Journal of Economics has adopted the American Economic Review data availability policy. We are grateful to the editors of the American Economic Review for their leadership in constructing this policy. 

It is the policy of the Quarterly Journal of Economics to publish papers only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication. Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work must provide to the QJE , prior to publication, the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication. These will be posted on a data repository linked to the QJE website. Submissions should include a cover letter in which the Editors are notified if the data used in a paper are proprietary or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met.

After acceptance, authors are expected to post their data, programs, and sufficient details to permit replication, to the QJE Dataverse repository. Complete instructions will be provided to the author with the acceptance letter."

## 3. American Economic Review, American Economic Association

"Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work must provide, prior to publication, the **data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication**. These will be posted on the AEA website. The Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the data used in a paper are proprietary or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met."

AEA hired a Data Editor to "maximize replicability and reproducibility of research findings published in AEA journals": [https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/labor-dynamics-institute/news/executive-director-vilhuber-named-aea-data-editor](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/labor-dynamics-institute/news/executive-director-vilhuber-named-aea-data-editor)

## 4. Econometrica, Econometric Society

"Econometrica has the policy that **all empirical, experimental and simulation results must be replicable**. Therefore, authors of accepted papers must submit data sets, programs, and information on empirical analysis, experiments and simulations that are needed for replication and some limited sensitivity analysis."

**5 years ago: NO policy or archive**

## 6. Journal of Financial Economics, Elsevier

"We expect authors to cooperate by providing code if a controversy arises where “replicating authors” cannot replicate the published work and the results of the replication attempt make the conclusions of the published paper invalid.  If the two sets of authors cannot resolve their disagreements, then the replicating authors can submit their paper for review at the JFE, along with all relevant correspondence between the replicating authors and the original authors. Much like our current dispute procedure, an anonymized version of this correspondence would be provided to the person who eventually referees the “replication paper.”  Of course, the standard used by the editor in making a decision about publication is whether the replication paper makes an important contribution to our understanding of financial economics.

We continue to **encourage authors** to provide code and data related to their published paper to be posted on the **JFE web page**, since we believe that this increases interest in the published research."

## 8. Review of Economic Studies, Oxford University Press

"Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, numerical simulations, or experimental work **must in principle** make available to the journal any data, programs, and details for the computations necessary for replication.  The submission of this material indicates that authors license users to download, copy, and modify it.  Such users must acknowledge all authors as the original creators and the Review of Economic Studies as the original publisher.  These will be posted alongside the article at Oxford Journals Review Archive. The Managing Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the above requirements cannot be met for any reason (see details below).  We reserve the right to refuse publication of papers whose authors do not comply with these requirements."

## 10. Journal of Monetary Economics, Elsevier

Elsevier recommends data sharing, but there is no requirement for this journal. "This journal encourages and enables you to share data that supports your research publication where appropriate, and enables you to interlink the data with your published articles. Research data refers to the results of observations or experimentation that validate research findings. To facilitate reproducibility and data reuse, this journal also encourages you to share your software, code, models, algorithms, protocols, methods and other useful materials related to the project." Publisher highlights ways to make data available, including linking in metadata to another repository, using Mendeley Data, creating a "Data Brief" (a data paper), or adding a data statement.

## 12. Review of Financial Studies, Society for Financial Studies

"The Editors of the Review of Financial Studies believe that authors of accepted papers that contain empirical analysis, simulations, numerical computations, or experimental work should be encouraged to provide the programs needed for replication to the RFS. **Authors should also be encouraged to include the data along with the source code.**

In order to encourage this activity, we will make the following changes in the editorial process:

(1) In every final acceptance letter for a paper in the RFS, we will include the following paragraph: “If you have any supplementary materials, including sample code, data, or regression results that will not be featured in the final version of the paper, they can be shared on the **Oxford University Press website** next to the link to the final published paper online. This is also the place where your conflict of interest disclosure statements will be available to readers. We, as editors, encourage you to make good use of this opportunity.”

(2) On the initial submission page of the RFS’s website, we will include the following paragraph as a bullet point: “If your paper is successfully published by the RFS and if you have any supplementary materials, including sample code, data, or regression results that will not be featured in the final version of the paper, they can be shared on the Oxford University Press website next to the link to the final published paper online. This will also be the place where your conflict of interest disclosure statements will be available to readers. We, as editors, encourage you to make good use of this opportunity. You are welcome to include such supplementary materials with your initial submission, which can be available to the Editor and which can be shared with the RFSers as long as they are absent any author identification.”

(3) On the published version of the paper where it is indicated when the paper was initially submitted, accepted and by which editor, we will add the following statement if the authors have supplied supplementary sample code or data: “Received [Submission Date]; editorial decision [Acceptance Date] by Editor [First Name] [Last Name]. Authors have furnished supplementary code or data which are available on the Oxford University Press website next to the link to the final published paper online.”"

Ref: http://rfssfs.org/voluntary-datacode-sharing-process/

## 13. Journal of Econometrics, Elsevier

**PUBLICATION POLICIES**

1. Upon acceptance of an article, authors will be asked to complete a 'Journal Publishing Agreement' (see D.5 below for more information). 

2. Authors are expected to submit replication code and data files once a paper is conditionally accepted. In case when proprietary data are used, replication code should be made available so that another researcher with the same data can reproduce the results. 

...

**Research data**

This journal encourages and enables you to share data that supports your research publication where appropriate, and enables you to interlink the data with your published articles. Research data refers to the results of observations or experimentation that validate research findings. To facilitate reproducibility and data reuse, this journal also encourages you to share your software, code, models, algorithms, protocols, methods and other useful materials related to the project.

Below are a number of ways in which you can associate data with your article or make a statement about the availability of your data when submitting your manuscript. If you are sharing data in one of these ways, you are encouraged to cite the data in your manuscript and reference list. Please refer to the "References" section for more information about data citation. For more information on depositing, sharing and using research data and other relevant research materials, visit the research data page.

## 14. The Review of Economics and Statistics, MIT Press

"The Review of Economics and Statistics is implementing a strict data and computer code availability policy for empirical papers. Authors of papers accepted for publication will be required to

- post their code and programs;
- post and document their data (or document their data and include instructions for how other researchers can obtain the data when the data have been obtained under an arrangement that precludes the posting of the data);
- post detailed readme files on-line before publication.

**The goal is to provide enough information to permit replication**. In addition to meeting all of the standard scientific review procedures, all published papers will be required to comply with this policy. Authors should indicate upon submission in instances where papers use proprietary data." Data is to be submitted on Dataverse.

## 20. Economic Journal, Royal Economic Society

The Economic Journal **requires authors of empirical and experimental papers to provide documentation of how their results were obtained in sufficient detail and accuracy to allow their results to be replicated**. When you submit a paper for consideration, you will be asked to confirm how you will comply with this policy. It is essential that you request data exemption at the point of submission if you are using proprietary data or any other restrictions on supplying the data.

## 21. Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Economic Studies Program, The Brookings Institution

The Brookings Papers on Economic Activity has adopted the policy on data availability being used by the American Economic Review and Journal of Political Economy. Specifically:

General Policy

It is the policy of BPEA to publish papers **only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication**. Authors of papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental results must provide to BPEA, in electronic form prior to publication, the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication. These materials will be posted on the BPEA web site. The editors should be notified in advance if the data used in a paper are proprietary or if this information cannot be provided for some other reason. Manuscripts not conforming to this data policy will not be published.

Specific Policy for Econometric and Simulation Papers

The materials delivered should include the data sets and programs used to run the final models, plus a description of how previous intermediate data sets and programs were employed to create the final data sets. Authors are invited to submit these intermediate data files and programs as an option; if they are not provided, authors must fully cooperate with investigators seeking to conduct a replication who request them. The data files and programs can be provided in any format using any statistical package or software. However, the programs must run without crashing on any computer with the correct software. Authors must provide a Readme PDF file listing all included files and documenting the purpose and format of each file provided, as well as instructing a user on how replication can be conducted. If a request for an exemption based on proprietary data is made, authors should inform the editors if the data can be accessed or obtained in some other way by independent researchers for purposes of replication. Authors are also asked to provide information on how the proprietary data can be obtained by others in their Readme PDF file. A copy of the programs used to create the final results is still required.

Ref: https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-for-authors/

## 22. RAND Journal of Economics, RAND Corporation

"Supporting information is **not essential** to the article but provides greater depth and background and may include tables, figures, videos, datasets, etc. This material can be submitted with your manuscript, and will appear online, without editing or typesetting. Guidelines on how to prepare this material and which formats and files sizes are acceptable. Please note that the provision of supporting information is not encouraged as a general rule. It will be assessed critically by reviewers and editors and may not be accepted."

## 24. European Economic Review, Elsevier

Yes, Journal has a "Mandatory Replication Policy" that states: 

"The European Economic Review’s will in general publish papers only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication. Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work must provide to the EER, prior to publication, the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication. These will be posted on the EER Web site. If the data used in a paper are proprietary or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met, the editors should be notified at the time of submission. It will be at the editors’ discretion whether the paper can then be reviewed. Exceptions will not be considered later in the review and publication process. Papers that do not submit this requested data will not enter the reviewing process."

## 25. Journal of Banking & Finance, Elsevier

Journal recommends data sharing: "This journal encourages and enables you to share data that supports your research publication where appropriate, and enables you to interlink the data with your published articles. Research data refers to the results of observations or experimentation that validate research findings. To facilitate reproducibility and data reuse, this journal also encourages you to share your software, code, models, algorithms, protocols, methods and other useful materials related to the project."

Suggested ways to share include: linking to data repository in metadata; using Mendeley Data; developing a "Data in Brief" (data article); including a data statement.

## 26. Journal of the European Economic Association, European Economic Association

"Please read this section carefully as we are unable to enter submissions that do not comply with our policy on data into the editorial process. 

JEEA will publish papers only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication. Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work, must provide to JEEA, prior to publication, the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication. These will be posted on the JEEA  web site.

The data policy was introduced in June 2009. All papers whose first submission (not “publication”, nor "acceptance") was after that date are subject to the data policy. Articles whose first submission date back to earlier than June 2009 are NOT subject to the data policy.

### Empirical papers:

For econometric and simulation papers, the authors should provide at least:
  - The data set(s) and programs used to run the final models. The data files can be provided in any standard format; the programs can be written in any standard programming language (including higher-level languages).
  - A description of how previous intermediate data sets and programs were employed to create the final data set(s).
  - A description of the purpose of each data set and program. Both description files should be provided in PDF format.

### Experimental papers: 

We expect authors of experimental articles to supply the following materials:
  - The design summary of the experiment.
  - The original instructions given to the subjects.
  - Information about subject eligibility or selection.
  - Any computer programs, configuration files or scripts used to run the experiment and/or to analyse the data.
  - The raw data from the experiment, with sufficient explanation to make it possible to use the submitted computer programs to replicate the data analysis.
On each of these five points, a summary should be given in the manuscript of the paper /and/ a complete version should be provided before publication for posting on the JEEA web site. Again, any description should be provided in a PDF format file.

### Proprietary data: 

As a matter of principle, we discourage papers that rely on completely proprietary data. Authors who feel that they can raise an exception should discuss this with the Editors. On the other hand, we will consider papers that are based on data that can only be available at some cost (either monetary or because access to the data is limited, e.g. to some Research Data Centre). In that case, the authors must still provide all programs and instructions a researcher would require to replicate their paper once (s)he has access to the data."

## 29. Economic Policy, CEPR; CES; MSH

"EP has the policy that all empirical, experimental and simulation results should, where possible, be accessible and replicable. **Authors of accepted papers are required to submit data sets, programs, a full list of data sources, and information on empirical analysis, experiments and simulations that are needed for replication. Replication will be carried out by the journal, and the material will be published alongside the article on the EP website.**

Authors who are unable to comply with this policy (e.g. due to the use of proprietary data or because individuals are identifiable from the data) must provide a reason to the EP editors, and they must provide information about how the data can be accessed and sufficient information for the results to be replicated by others who obtain access to the data. The editors reserve the right to refuse to publish articles where the data, programs etc are not provided and where, in their view, there is no justifiable reason for not making them available."

Ref: https://academic.oup.com/economicpolicy/pages/General_Instructions

## 30. Journal of Human Resources, University of Wisconsin Press

Yes, Policy on Replication and Data Availability most recently revised in August 2018. 

Manuscripts submitted to the JHR will be judged in part by whether they have reconciled their results with already published research on the same topic. In cases where a past study has obtained different results for reasons that are not obvious on an a priori basis, authors may be required to perform some comparative estimation with their own data set. In addition, the JHR will continue its existing policy of requiring authors to present the results of sensitivity tests.

Authors of accepted manuscripts will be asked to preserve the data used in their analysis and to make the data available online in a well-curated repository (for example, the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), The Dataverse Project, or one’s institutional repository) in the public domain [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) license]. Authors are required to provide their archive plans as a footnote with the submitted manuscript, including a persistent link (preferably a DOI link) to the data set. Authors are responsible for making available complete replication materials, including the data and code, models, and other materials necessary for replication, along with a read-me file to assist others in using the data.

If the data are publicly available or, on the other hand, an exemption has been requested, authors should provide any supporting replication materials that can be supplied to assist researchers with replication, to be published with the manuscript as an Online Appendix.

Authors wishing to request an exemption from the data availability requirement should notify the editors at the time of manuscript submission; otherwise, authors will be assumed to accept the requirement. The use of proprietary data sets, for example, may prompt an exemption request. The JHR may grant a waiver of the replication policy if the data meet these criteria: (i) there is any method at all by which other researchers may obtain the data, and (ii) the authors commit to providing guidance about obtaining the data. In requesting a waiver, please provide a brief explanation of why the waiver is required and how you meet these criteria.

Authors who wish clarification of any aspect of this policy statement may write to the editor.

Data Availability Statement
Authors must include a statement on the title page of the manuscript in the author affiliations footnote indicating data availability, providing a persistent (preferably DOI) link to the data in a repository. If the JHR granted a waiver, add a waiver statement describing why the data are not available and whether they can be obtained through any means."

## World Bank Economic Review

"The World Bank Economic Review **requires that accepted papers include sufficient information on data sources and methods** that work can be replicated by other researchers. This requirement is normally met through online posting on the journal website of a file that includes archival summary, data and relevant computational files. If data are proprietary or the requirement otherwise cannot be met, this should be noted in a cover letter to the editor on submission."

## International Economic Review

"To promote consistent standards and requirements among general-interest journals in the field of economics, the International Economic Review has adopted the AER data availability policy. We are grateful to the editors of the American Economic Review for constructing this policy.

Data Availability Policy

It is the policy of the IER to publish papers only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication. Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work must provide to the Review, prior to publication, the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication. These will be posted on the IER web site. The Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the data used in a paper are proprietary or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met.

After acceptance, authors are expected to send their data, programs, and sufficient details to permit replication, in electronic form, to the IER office."

## Review of Economic Dyanmics, Society for Economics Dynamics journal

"Starting from January 1, 2008, the Review of Economic Dynamics implements a new policy regarding the availability of data and computer code for published papers.

Authors of accepted papers are required, before final acceptance, to provide to RED the data and computer code used in generating the results of the paper. This material will be posted on the journal’s web site and should be sufficient to enable other researchers to replicate the results of the paper.

For papers that use empirical data, authors have to provide the final data sets used to obtain the empirical results of the paper, as well as the computer code(s) used to manipulate the data set. A readme.txt file should be included describing how the program(s) can be run. If the final data set was created from other sources, a description of how the final data set was created from the previous sources is also required. This description should be sufficiently detailed to allow other researchers to replicate the construction of the final data set.

For papers that contain numerical results authors have to provide the final programs that generate the results in the paper, plus a readme.txt file describing how the programs can be run, which program generates what results, etc. The results used for the summary statistics and/or graphs should be included."

"JAE Data Archive: Authors of accepted papers are required to deposit in electronic form a complete set of data used onto the Journal's Data Archive, unless they are confidential. In cases where there are restrictions on the dissemination of the data, the responsibility of obtaining the required permission to use the data rests with the interested investigator and not with the author.

Authors are also encouraged to provide whatever other material is needed to ensure that their results can be replicated without excessive difficulty. This might include computer programs or technical appendices that are not part of the paper itself."
