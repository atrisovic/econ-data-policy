# Economics Data Policies

Data policies in top economics journals and their focus on result replication/reproducibility.

## American Economic Review

"Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work must provide, prior to publication, the **data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication**. These will be posted on the AEA website. The Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the data used in a paper are proprietary or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met."

AEA hired a Data Editor to "maximize replicability and reproducibility of research findings published in AEA journals": [https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/labor-dynamics-institute/news/executive-director-vilhuber-named-aea-data-editor](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/labor-dynamics-institute/news/executive-director-vilhuber-named-aea-data-editor)

## Econometrica

"Econometrica has the policy that **all empirical, experimental and simulation results must be replicable**. Therefore, authors of accepted papers must submit data sets, programs, and information on empirical analysis, experiments and simulations that are needed for replication and some limited sensitivity analysis."

## Journal of Political Economy

"In an effort to promote consistent standards and requirements among general-interest journals in the field of economics, the Journal of Political Economy has adopted the AER data availability policy. We are grateful to the editors of the American Economic Review for their leadership in constructing this policy."

## Quarterly Journal of Economics

"In an effort to promote consistent standards and requirements among general-interest journals in the field of economics, the Quarterly Journal of Economics has adopted the American Economic Review data availability policy. We are grateful to the editors of the American Economic Review for their leadership in constructing this policy. 

[...] 

After acceptance, authors are expected to post their data, programs, and sufficient details to permit replication, to the QJE Dataverse repository. Complete instructions will be provided to the author with the acceptance letter."

## Review of Economic Studies

"Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, numerical simulations, or experimental work must in principle make available to the journal any data, programs, and details for the computations necessary for replication.  The submission of this material indicates that authors license users to download, copy, and modify it.  Such users must acknowledge all authors as the original creators and the Review of Economic Studies as the original publisher.  These will be posted alongside the article at Oxford Journals Review Archive. The Managing Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the above requirements cannot be met for any reason (see details below).  We reserve the right to refuse publication of papers whose authors do not comply with these requirements."

## Journal of Labor Economics

"In an effort to promote consistent standards and requirements among general-interest journals in the field of economics, the Journal of Labor Economics has adopted the AER data availability policy. We are grateful to the editors of the American Economic Review for their leadership in constructing this policy. JOLE adopted this policy in February 2009; it applies to all articles submitted after that date."

## The Review of Economics and Statistics

"The Review of Economics and Statistics is implementing a strict data and computer code availability policy for empirical papers. Authors of papers accepted for publication will be required to

- post their code and programs;
- post and document their data (or document their data and include instructions for how other researchers can obtain the data when the data have been obtained under an arrangement that precludes the posting of the data);
- post detailed readme files on-line before publication.

**The goal is to provide enough information to permit replication**. In addition to meeting all of the standard scientific review procedures, all published papers will be required to comply with this policy. Authors should indicate upon submission in instances where papers use proprietary data." Data is to be submitted on Dataverse.

## American Journal of Political Science

"The corresponding author of a manuscript that is accepted for publication in the American Journal of Political Science must provide replication materials that are sufficient to enable interested researchers to reproduce all of the analytic results that are reported in the text and supporting materials."

## Journal of International Economics

Elsevier journal; There does not appear to be a data policy for Journal of International Economics, but journal page links out to information about sharing research data.
