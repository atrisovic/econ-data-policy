# Economics Data Policies

Data policies in top economics journals and their focus on result replication/reproducibility.

## Overview

The ranking list of journals was obtained from: https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.journals.all.html

## 1. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Oxford University Press

"In an effort to promote consistent standards and requirements among general-interest journals in the field of economics, the Quarterly Journal of Economics has adopted the American Economic Review data availability policy. We are grateful to the editors of the American Economic Review for their leadership in constructing this policy. 

[...] 

After acceptance, authors are expected to post their data, programs, and sufficient details to permit replication, to the QJE Dataverse repository. Complete instructions will be provided to the author with the acceptance letter."

## 2. Journal of Political Economy, University of Chicago Press

"In an effort to promote consistent standards and requirements among general-interest journals in the field of economics, the Journal of Political Economy has adopted the AER data availability policy. We are grateful to the editors of the American Economic Review for their leadership in constructing this policy."

Ref: [https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/jpe/datapolicy](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/jpe/datapolicy)

## 3. American Economic Review, American Economic Association

"Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work must provide, prior to publication, the **data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication**. These will be posted on the AEA website. The Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the data used in a paper are proprietary or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met."

AEA hired a Data Editor to "maximize replicability and reproducibility of research findings published in AEA journals": [https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/labor-dynamics-institute/news/executive-director-vilhuber-named-aea-data-editor](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/labor-dynamics-institute/news/executive-director-vilhuber-named-aea-data-editor)

## 4. Econometrica, Econometric Society

"Econometrica has the policy that **all empirical, experimental and simulation results must be replicable**. Therefore, authors of accepted papers must submit data sets, programs, and information on empirical analysis, experiments and simulations that are needed for replication and some limited sensitivity analysis." 

Ref: [https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/information-authors/instructions-submitting-articles](https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/information-authors/instructions-submitting-articles)

## 5. Journal of Economic Literature, American Economic Association

"It is the policy of the American Economic Association to **publish papers only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available** to any researcher for purposes of replication."

Ref: https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-availability-policy

## 6. Journal of Financial Economics, Elsevier

"We expect authors to cooperate by providing code if a controversy arises where “replicating authors” cannot replicate the published work and the results of the replication attempt make the conclusions of the published paper invalid.  If the two sets of authors cannot resolve their disagreements, then the replicating authors can submit their paper for review at the JFE, along with all relevant correspondence between the replicating authors and the original authors. Much like our current dispute procedure, an anonymized version of this correspondence would be provided to the person who eventually referees the “replication paper.”  Of course, the standard used by the editor in making a decision about publication is whether the replication paper makes an important contribution to our understanding of financial economics.

We continue to **encourage authors** to provide code and data related to their published paper to be posted on the **JFE web page**, since we believe that this increases interest in the published research."

Ref: http://jfe.rochester.edu/replication.htm

## 7. Journal of Finance, American Finance Association
## 8. Review of Economic Studies, Oxford University Press

"Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, numerical simulations, or experimental work **must in principle** make available to the journal any data, programs, and details for the computations necessary for replication.  The submission of this material indicates that authors license users to download, copy, and modify it.  Such users must acknowledge all authors as the original creators and the Review of Economic Studies as the original publisher.  These will be posted alongside the article at Oxford Journals Review Archive. The Managing Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the above requirements cannot be met for any reason (see details below).  We reserve the right to refuse publication of papers whose authors do not comply with these requirements."

## 9. Journal of Economic Growth, Springer

Doesn't seem to have a data policy.

## 10. Journal of Monetary Economics, Elsevier
## 11. Journal of Economic Perspectives, American Economic Association

It is the policy of the American Economic Association to publish papers **only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available** to any researcher for purposes of replication.

Ref: https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-availability-policy

## 12. Review of Financial Studies, Society for Financial Studies

"The Editors of the Review of Financial Studies believe that authors of accepted papers that contain empirical analysis, simulations, numerical computations, or experimental work should be encouraged to provide the programs needed for replication to the RFS. **Authors should also be encouraged to include the data along with the source code.**

In order to encourage this activity, we will make the following changes in the editorial process:

(1) In every final acceptance letter for a paper in the RFS, we will include the following paragraph: “If you have any supplementary materials, including sample code, data, or regression results that will not be featured in the final version of the paper, they can be shared on the **Oxford University Press website** next to the link to the final published paper online. This is also the place where your conflict of interest disclosure statements will be available to readers. We, as editors, encourage you to make good use of this opportunity.”

(2) On the initial submission page of the RFS’s website, we will include the following paragraph as a bullet point: “If your paper is successfully published by the RFS and if you have any supplementary materials, including sample code, data, or regression results that will not be featured in the final version of the paper, they can be shared on the Oxford University Press website next to the link to the final published paper online. This will also be the place where your conflict of interest disclosure statements will be available to readers. We, as editors, encourage you to make good use of this opportunity. You are welcome to include such supplementary materials with your initial submission, which can be available to the Editor and which can be shared with the RFSers as long as they are absent any author identification.”

(3) On the published version of the paper where it is indicated when the paper was initially submitted, accepted and by which editor, we will add the following statement if the authors have supplied supplementary sample code or data: “Received [Submission Date]; editorial decision [Acceptance Date] by Editor [First Name] [Last Name]. Authors have furnished supplementary code or data which are available on the Oxford University Press website next to the link to the final published paper online.”"

## 13. Journal of Econometrics, Elsevier
## 14. The Review of Economics and Statistics, MIT Press

"The Review of Economics and Statistics is implementing a strict data and computer code availability policy for empirical papers. Authors of papers accepted for publication will be required to

- post their code and programs;
- post and document their data (or document their data and include instructions for how other researchers can obtain the data when the data have been obtained under an arrangement that precludes the posting of the data);
- post detailed readme files on-line before publication.

**The goal is to provide enough information to permit replication**. In addition to meeting all of the standard scientific review procedures, all published papers will be required to comply with this policy. Authors should indicate upon submission in instances where papers use proprietary data." Data is to be submitted on Dataverse.

Ref: [https://www.mitpressjournals.org/journals/rest/sub](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/journals/rest/sub)

## 15. Journal of International Economics, Elsevier

There does not appear to be a data policy for Journal of International Economics, but journal page links out to information about sharing research data.

## 16. Journal of Labor Economics, University of Chicago Press

"In an effort to promote consistent standards and requirements among general-interest journals in the field of economics, the Journal of Labor Economics has adopted the AER data availability policy. We are grateful to the editors of the American Economic Review for their leadership in constructing this policy. JOLE adopted this policy in February 2009; it applies to all articles submitted after that date."

"Supporting information is **not essential** to the article but provides greater depth and background and may include tables, figures, videos, datasets, etc. This material can be submitted with your manuscript, and will appear online, without editing or typesetting. Guidelines on how to prepare this material and which formats and files sizes are acceptable. Please note that the provision of supporting information is not encouraged as a general rule. It will be assessed critically by reviewers and editors and may not be accepted."

Ref: https://www.rje.org/submissions.html

## 23. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, American Economic Association

It is the policy of the American Economic Association to publish papers **only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available** to any researcher for purposes of replication.

## 24. European Economic Review, Elsevier
## 25. Journal of Banking & Finance, Elsevier
## 26. Journal of the European Economic Association, European Economic Association

"Please read this section carefully as we are unable to enter submissions that do not comply with our policy on data into the editorial process. 

JEEA will publish papers only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication. Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work, must provide to JEEA, prior to publication, the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication. These will be posted on the JEEA  web site.

The data policy was introduced in June 2009. All papers whose first submission (not “publication”, nor "acceptance") was after that date are subject to the data policy. Articles whose first submission date back to earlier than June 2009 are NOT subject to the data policy.

### Empirical papers:

For econometric and simulation papers, the authors should provide at least:
  - The data set(s) and programs used to run the final models. The data files can be provided in any standard format; the programs can be written in any standard programming language (including higher-level languages).
  - A description of how previous intermediate data sets and programs were employed to create the final data set(s).
  - A description of the purpose of each data set and program. Both description files should be provided in PDF format.

### Experimental papers: 

We expect authors of experimental articles to supply the following materials:
  - The design summary of the experiment.
  - The original instructions given to the subjects.
  - Information about subject eligibility or selection.
  - Any computer programs, configuration files or scripts used to run the experiment and/or to analyse the data.
  - The raw data from the experiment, with sufficient explanation to make it possible to use the submitted computer programs to replicate the data analysis.
On each of these five points, a summary should be given in the manuscript of the paper /and/ a complete version should be provided before publication for posting on the JEEA web site. Again, any description should be provided in a PDF format file.

### Proprietary data: 

As a matter of principle, we discourage papers that rely on completely proprietary data. Authors who feel that they can raise an exception should discuss this with the Editors. On the other hand, we will consider papers that are based on data that can only be available at some cost (either monetary or because access to the data is limited, e.g. to some Research Data Centre). In that case, the authors must still provide all programs and instructions a researcher would require to replicate their paper once (s)he has access to the data."

## 27. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, Elsevier
## 28. Journal of Economic Theory, Elsevier
## 29. Economic Policy, CEPR; CES; MSH

"EP has the policy that all empirical, experimental and simulation results should, where possible, be accessible and replicable. **Authors of accepted papers are required to submit data sets, programs, a full list of data sources, and information on empirical analysis, experiments and simulations that are needed for replication. Replication will be carried out by the journal, and the material will be published alongside the article on the EP website.**

Authors who are unable to comply with this policy (e.g. due to the use of proprietary data or because individuals are identifiable from the data) must provide a reason to the EP editors, and they must provide information about how the data can be accessed and sufficient information for the results to be replicated by others who obtain access to the data. The editors reserve the right to refuse to publish articles where the data, programs etc are not provided and where, in their view, there is no justifiable reason for not making them available."

Ref: https://academic.oup.com/economicpolicy/pages/General_Instructions

## 30. Journal of Human Resources, University of Wisconsin Press

## World Bank Economic Review

"The World Bank Economic Review **requires that accepted papers include sufficient information on data sources and methods** that work can be replicated by other researchers. This requirement is normally met through online posting on the journal website of a file that includes archival summary, data and relevant computational files. If data are proprietary or the requirement otherwise cannot be met, this should be noted in a cover letter to the editor on submission."

Ref: https://academic.oup.com/wber/pages/Author_Guidelines

## American Journal of Political Science

"The corresponding author of a manuscript that is accepted for publication in the American Journal of Political Science must provide replication materials that are sufficient to enable interested researchers to reproduce all of the analytic results that are reported in the text and supporting materials."
